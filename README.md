# Neural Networks from Scratch in `X`

The idea here is to share [Neural Networks from Scratch tutorial parts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3) / [Neural Networks from Scratch book](https://nnfs.io) in various other programming languages, besides just Python. 

If you're following along in another language, feel free to contribute to your specific language via a pull request. If you're considering trying to use another language, you can see how others have achieved writing the neural networks from scratch in other languages here too.


# How to contribute: 

The plan is to share code from video part #s. I will be updating the Python variants, so, if you are just following the [book](https://nnfs.io), you can see which block(s) of code should be translated by checking out the Python versions.

Before submitting a PR, check to see if there's already a PR from someone for that specific part # and language. 

I will be accepting PRs in the following ways:

1. Prioritizing the already-established people who have contributed to that language already.
2. Prioritizing by who submits first.
